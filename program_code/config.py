"""
If you want to replace a default path with your own, comment out the default path you want to replace,
edit one of the below example paths, and uncomment it. Don't forget the last slash at the end!!
NOTE: The custom path you add MUST be absolute, meaning it must begin at your hard drive if in Windows (e.g. C:/ )
      or at your home directory if in MacOS (e.g. ~/ )
